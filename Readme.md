### Latest

Add Settings in to pick and choose which part of the mod pack to use.

Project Corona Map Generator Preset now works with Vanilla, Bob's Ores, and Omnimatter or and combination of the three.

### Previously

Bug fixes (see changelog)

### Plans Going Forward

Add more optional dependencies and configure their quick keys to not conflict with one another by default.  Potentially a help command and/or GUI to list only mod related quick keys.

## Description

The main objective is to have a list of optional dependencies that are tested for compatibility and play-ability.

This is an attempt to remove/replace duplicate or redundant items between multiple mods while adding some other things in.

~~No trees will spawn and no water tiles will be auto generated.~~ Added settings to make these optional in version 0.18.3.

Here are all the mods I use on my play-through's: [My Mod List][personal-mod-list]. (This probably won't be kept up to date and some of these mods don't work with 0.18 unless you update their "factorio_version": to "0.18" in their info.json files)

#### Starting Items

Item|Qty
---|---:
Burner Mining Drill | 1
Burner Omnitractor (w/ Omnimatter mod) | 1
Iron Plate | 8
Magazine | 10
Pistol | 1
Seedling (w/ Bob's Greenhouse mod) | 50
Small Electric Pole (w/ Treeless Map enabled) | 20
Stone Furnace | 1
Stone Water Well (w/ Stone Water Well mod) | 1
Wood (removed w/ Treeless Map enabled) | 1

### Added/Manipulated Items

Adds an MK6 Power Armor if [Bob's Warfare Mod][bobwarfare-mod-page] is used.

Re-skins the [Miniloader Mod][miniloader-mod-page] with [Deadlock's Loaders][deadlock-mod-page] graphics.  This was done so they match the look of the beltbox's correctly and will also load/unload train cargo wagons.

The code for the "The Big Furnace" & "Circuit Factory" mods created by **[DellAquila][dellaquila-page]** has been used within this mod and doesn't require them as dependents. (Changed their size and removed their included loaders)

The ability to remove trees and water from spawning on the map.
