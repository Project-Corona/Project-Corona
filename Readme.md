#### Plans Going Forward

Add more optional dependencies and configure their quick keys to not conflict with one another by default.

## Description

The main objective is to have a list of dependant and optional mods called for that are tested for compatibility and playability.

This is an attempt to remove/replace duplicate or redundant items between multiple mods while adding some other things in.

No trees will spawn and no water tiles will be auto generated.

Here are all the mods I use on my play-through's: [My Mod List][personal-mod-list] (This probably won't be kept up to date and some of these mods don't work with 0.18)

#### Starting Items

Item|Qty
---|---:
Small Electric Pole | 20
Burner Mining Drill | 1
Stone Water Well | 1
Stone Furnace | 1
Iron Plate | 8
Seedling | 50
Burner Omnitractor | 1

### Added/Manipulated Items

Adds an MK6 Power if [Bob's Warfare Mod][bobwarfare-mod-page] is used.

Re-skins the [Miniloader Mod][miniloader-mod-page] with [Deadlock's Loaders][deadlock-mod-page] so they match the stacking beltbox graphic's.  This was done so they look correct and load/unload train cargo wagons.

DellAquila's [Circuit Factory Mod][circuit-factory-mod]

The code for the "The Big Furnace" & "Circuit Factory" mods created by **[DellAquila][dellaquila-page]** has been used within this mod and doesn't require them as dependants. (Changed their size and removed their included loaders)

## Special Thanks

A lot of what I've learned to create this started with help from "[DWG][dwg-github-page]" the maintainer of "[Anoyomouse's][Anoyomouse-github-page]" [Warehousing Mod][warehousing-mod-page]
