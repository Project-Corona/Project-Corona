## Description

The main objective is to have a list of dependant and optional mods called for that are tested for compatibility and playability.

This is an attempt to remove/replace duplicate or redundant items between multiple mods while adding some other things in.

No trees will spawn and no water tiles will be auto generated.

#### Starting Items

Item|Qty
---|---:
Small Electric Pole | 20
Burner Mining Drill | 1
Stone Water Well | 1
Stone Furnace | 1
Iron Plate | 8
Seedling | 50
Burner Omnitractor | 1

DellAquila's [Circuit Factory Mod][circuit-factory-mod]

The code for the "The Big Furnace" & "Circuit Factory" mods created by **[DellAquila][dellaquila-page]** has been used within this mod and doesn't require them as dependants. (Changed their size and removed their included loaders)

## Special Thanks

A lot of what I've learned to create this started with help from "[DWG][dwg-github-page]" the maintainer of "[Anoyomouse's][Anoyomouse-github-page]" [Warehousing Mod][warehousing-mod-page]
